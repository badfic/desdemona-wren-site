I mean that with everything in me.\nPro-tip: Before we start, you’re going to definitely want to have all your images at 300 DPI. If you don’t know how to do that, check out this tutorial.\nRight now I’m gonna tell you guys a secret. I literally am only releasing my book on Kindle or on Amazon because Amazon makes it a whole hell of a lot easier to format and publish books than anything else.\nBefore my friend Jason Lane showed me “de way” I was trying to use scrivener which is probably one of the most confusing programs ever. Let’s be real here, it’s a nightmare.\nI personally, couldn’t figure out how to\n Fix my chapter headings Fix my page numbers How to get my front matter to not show up as an actually chapter How to fix my table of contents  I promise you guys, if you’re new to formatting scrivener isn’t the way to go.\nSome authors swear by Vellum, but since Vellum is only for Mac users and since I’m a die-hard PC user with a custom built machine, I probably won’t be using that.\nSo here’s what my good bro Jason told me.\nFormat everything in Google Docs, download it as a docx, upload it to KDP and Amazon takes care of the rest. Literally. Amazon will format that shit for you and I 1000% recommend using Google Docs for everything.\nMy print book was a little more difficult, however. Since in print books you’re required to have page numbers, Google Docs won’t work for that.\nSee, in book writing, your page numbers should not appear on any front matter pages (things like the table of contents, title page, dedication, and copyright page).Google Docs, in its infinite wisdom will not allow you to have custom page numbers. There used to be an add-on for it, but it was taken down.\nSo, for print, you’re going to have to use Microsoft Word to get those page numbers right.\nAlso, a real quick tutorial on print. It is so much different than formatting for Kindle.\nWith Kindle all you need are:\n A front cover Your manuscript Any graphics you want to put in your manuscript Your front matter  With print, you’re going to need:\n A front and back cover.  Use this Createspace Template it will work wonders.  Your pages need to be set to the book size you chose.  Standard seems to be 6x9  You can do this in word by going to Page Layout and Selecting Size, Custom Size, and setting your page size.  A whole hell of a lot of patience.  You will have to re-upload your book more than once to both KDP and Amazon Print. I promise you, there will be glaring formatting errors that you absolutely need to fix.\nPro-Tip: I’m going to save you guys a ton of time too, for Kindle DO NOT make your chapter fonts, or headings, or any of your font period larger that 18pt.\nPeople can and will resize shit and it’ll make your formatting look like trash. So Keep it simple!\nDon’t forget to buy Bloom RIGHT NOW on Amazon in Paperback or on Kindle. It’s also available to read FOR FREE on Kindle Unlimited.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"411ee9959339fa91f5ad0e236cb23cf2","tags":["Bloom","Making of","teratophilia","LGBT","Transgender"],"title":"The Making of Bloom: Part Two","type":"article","url":"/article/making-of-bloom-part-two/"},{"author":"Desdemona Wren","categories":["Bloom","Making of","teratophilia","LGBT","Trans"],"content":"I’ve written a piece on my personal writing process, but here’s what it was like to write Bloom: A Monster Love Novella from start to finish.\nSometimes shit got real stressful, so if you’re thinking about writing a book, know this: it is not easy, you will cry real tears, and formatting is an absolute pain in the ass..\nIt all started with an idea.\nLike most of my ideas, it was half-baked and sort of uttered once to one of my friends as a joke. We were talking about Chuck Tingle and how I should write a weird teratophilia (aka monster love) book about lesbian trees with a bunch of tree puns.\nThen, like all of my ideas do, shit got serious real fast.\nIt’s impossible for me to write crack once I get a good idea for a character. And in Holly’s case, I wanted to make her trans.\nThere aren’t a lot of books out there normalizing trans people, and I wanted to do that with Bloom. I wanted Holly to be a character people could connect to. Especially people who don’t have a lot of representation.\nSo I couldn’t have Holly be a crack character. She needed to be this really cool likable bro who likes science and bees and is really sweet and that’s what she became.\nIt actually took me around a year of puttering around to write this. I started it in February of 2017, but got distracted by working on a different series called Wixen.\nWixen is a looot longer than Bloom. The first book is roughly 500 pages and it’s called Poisons, Potions, \u0026amp; Propositions. The second book just hit 550 pages and it is still in heavy edits. There’s also a novella for that too, but I digress.\nI knew I wanted to self-publish Bloom. I wanted to do it as a birthday present for one of my friends. So this year when I finally got fed up with writing Wixen, I set to work on finishing Bloom.\nI did all of the writing, editing, graphic design, social media, and grammar editing myself. I don’t recommend doing this. I have a background in professional editing, graphic design, and social media because I went into integrated marketing instead of english.\nThis doesn’t mean that people with an english degree can’t also do this, but I have professional experience with doing all of this so I mean. I know my work is at least decent. The point is, unless you have prior professional experience I’d go ahead and outsource.\nYou can get some people who do great work for real cheap on Fiverr. For your first book, I would definitely start there editing and cover design wise. You will have to pay extra per book length.\nWriting the first chapters of Bloom weren’t hard. Writing isn’t the hard part. It’s stressful and it sucks, but once you hit a point where you realize you need to get the words out and edit later, you’ll start pumping out 2000-3000 words a day.\nI wrote roughly 4500 words a day for Bloom, with the most words being 10,000 in one 24 hour period. You have to be vigilant and you have to absolutely want this because you can pull some long ass hours trying to meet a deadline.\nThe hard part is editing, and I love editing.\nOnce the words are all out and the story is finished, you can breathe for a few days. Then take editing page by page.\nAs a general rule, I usually do at least 10 passes over a chapter, depending on how bad it is when I rewrite it. For Bloom I was on a very quick deadline, so I only did 4 and one Google Translate edit.\nIf you guys don’t know what a Google Translate edit it, it’s when you copy and paste your writing page by page into Google Translate and have it read the story aloud to you. It is an absolute lifesaver for grammar and spelling and tense.\nAfter I did a Google Translate edit, I moved on to ProWritingAid, which helps with grammar editing and overuse of words. I have a tendency to overuse adverbs, and “just”, and “that”, so I need a tool that helps me pinpoint all of that tomfoolery.\nAll in all, it took me two months to finish writing, edit, and format a novella.\nPro tip: Give yourself more time. Four to five months would be much better and less stressful, especially if you’ve never formatted before.\nThen, just like that, I was finished. Which is a huge relief because of all the work that went into it.\nFor the sake of my sanity, and yours, I’ll do a separate blog about formatting. I know how difficult it is and finding a blog to help is a pain, but I’ll walk you through it lickity split!\nStay tuned for that monstrosity.\nDon’t forget to buy Bloom RIGHT NOW on Amazon in Paperback or on Kindle. It’s also available to read FOR FREE on Kindle Unlimited.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"f3215639e0795c99565dfe23c5c1925a","tags":["Bloom","Making of","teratophilia","LGBT","Trans"],"title":"The Making of Bloom: Part One","type":"article","url":"/article/making-of-bloom-part-one/"}]
