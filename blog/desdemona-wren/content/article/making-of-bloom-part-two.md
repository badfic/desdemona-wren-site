Formatting might actually be worse than writing and editing and cover design. I mean that with everything in me. 

**Pro-tip:** Before we start, you’re going to definitely want to have all your images at 300 DPI. If you don’t know how to do that, check out this [tutorial](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+set+images+to+300DPI).

Right now I’m gonna tell you guys a secret. I literally am only releasing my book on [Kindle](https://amazon.com/dp/B07B4SLH9S) or on [Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/1980433933) because **Amazon** makes it a whole hell of a lot easier to format and publish books than anything else. 

Before my friend Jason Lane showed me “de way” I was trying to use **scrivener** which is probably one of the most confusing programs ever. Let’s be real here, it’s a nightmare. 

I personally, couldn’t figure out how to

1. Fix my chapter headings
2. Fix my page numbers
3. How to get my front matter to not show up as an actually *chapter*
4. How to fix my table of contents

I promise you guys, if you’re new to formatting **scrivener** isn’t the way to go. 

Some authors swear by **Vellum**, but since Vellum is only for Mac users and since I’m a die-hard PC user with a custom built machine, I probably won’t be using that. 

So here’s what my good bro Jason told me. 

Format everything in **Google Docs**, download it as a docx, upload it to KDP and Amazon takes care of the rest. Literally. Amazon will format that shit for you and I 1000% recommend using Google Docs for everything. 

[My print book](https://amazon.com/dp/1980433933) was a little more difficult, however. Since in print books you’re required to have page numbers, Google Docs won’t work for that. 

See, in book writing, your page numbers should *not* appear on any front matter pages (things like the table of contents, title page, dedication, and copyright page).Google Docs, in its infinite wisdom will *not* allow you to have custom page numbers. There used to be an add-on for it, but it was taken down.

So, for print, you’re going to have to use **Microsoft Word** to get those page numbers right. 

Also, a real quick tutorial on print. It is so much different than formatting for Kindle. 

**With Kindle all you need are:**

1. A front cover
2. Your manuscript
3. Any graphics you want to put in your manuscript
4. Your front matter

**With print, you’re going to need:**

1. A front and back cover. 
    * Use this [Createspace Template](https://www.createspace.com/Help/Book/Artwork.do) it will work wonders.
2. Your pages need to be set to the book size you chose.
    * Standard seems to be 6x9
+ You can do this in word by going to Page Layout and Selecting Size, Custom Size, and setting your page size.

3. A whole hell of a lot of patience.

You *will* have to re-upload your book more than once to both KDP and Amazon Print. I promise you, there will be glaring formatting errors that you absolutely need to fix. 

**Pro-Tip:** I’m going to save you guys a ton of time too, for Kindle *DO NOT* make your chapter fonts, or headings, or any of your font *period* larger that 18pt.

People can and *will* resize shit and it’ll make your formatting look like trash. So Keep it simple! 

Don’t forget to buy Bloom RIGHT NOW on Amazon in [Paperback](https://amazon.com/dp/1980433933) or on [Kindle](https://amazon.com/dp/B07B4SLH9S). It’s also available to read **FOR FREE** on Kindle Unlimited.
